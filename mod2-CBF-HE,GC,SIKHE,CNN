In this code, the MNIST dataset is used as an example. The image enhancement techniques include curvature Butterworth filter,
histogram equalization, and gamma correction. These techniques are applied to the dataset to enhance the images.
Then, feature selection is performed using the Krill Herd (SIKH) algorithm to select a subset of features. 
The VGG16 model is used as the base model for the CNN, and additional layers are added on top of it. 
The selected features are used for training, validation, and testing datasets. The model is compiled and trained using the selected features. 
Finally, the accuracy of the model is evaluated on the testing dataset.
