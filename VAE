Sure! Here's a concise implementation of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) in Python using the Keras library:

```python
import numpy as np
from keras.layers import Input, Dense, Lambda
from keras.models import Model
from keras.losses import mse
from keras import backend as K
from keras.datasets import mnist

# Load MNIST dataset
(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize and flatten input data
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_train = x_train.reshape((len(x_train), np.prod(x_train.shape[1:])))
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.0
x_test = x_test.reshape((len(x_test), np.prod(x_test.shape[1:])))

# Set dimensions
input_dim = x_train.shape[1]
hidden_dim = 256
latent_dim = 2

# Encoder network
inputs = Input(shape=(input_dim,))
hidden = Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')(inputs)
z_mean = Dense(latent_dim)(hidden)
z_log_var = Dense(latent_dim)(hidden)

# Reparameterization trick
def sampling(args):
    z_mean, z_log_var = args
    epsilon = K.random_normal(shape=(K.shape(z_mean)[0], latent_dim), mean=0.0, stddev=1.0)
    return z_mean + K.exp(0.5 * z_log_var) * epsilon

z = Lambda(sampling)([z_mean, z_log_var])

# Decoder network
decoder_hidden = Dense(hidden_dim, activation='relu')
decoder_output = Dense(input_dim, activation='sigmoid')

hidden_decoded = decoder_hidden(z)
outputs = decoder_output(hidden_decoded)

# Define VAE model
vae = Model(inputs, outputs)

# Define loss function
reconstruction_loss = mse(inputs, outputs)
kl_loss = -0.5 * K.mean(1 + z_log_var - K.square(z_mean) - K.exp(z_log_var), axis=-1)
vae_loss = K.mean(reconstruction_loss + kl_loss)

vae.add_loss(vae_loss)
vae.compile(optimizer='adam')

# Train the VAE
vae.fit(x_train, epochs=10, batch_size=128, validation_data=(x_test, None))
```

This code implements a VAE using Keras with a simple encoder-decoder architecture. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset. 
The encoder network consists of a single hidden layer, while the decoder network is symmetrical to the encoder. 
The VAE is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss (mean squared error) while regularizing the latent space using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. 
The `sampling` function implements the reparameterization trick to sample from the learned latent distribution during training. 
The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, and then trained for 10 epochs using a batch size of 128.

Here's an example code that incorporates the steps you mentioned: image enhancement (adaptive median filter, histogram equalization, gamma correction),

svm.fit(x_train_selected, y_train)
y_pred = svm.predict(x_test_selected)

```

This code assumes you have implemented the AACO algorithm or have a library available for it. 
It also assumes you have implemented the CNN model architecture and the Adaptive SVM model or have libraries available for them. 
Adjust the code according to your specific implementation or use appropriate libraries.

The code preprocesses the image dataset by applying an adaptive median filter, histogram equalization, and gamma correction. 
Then, it uses a VAE to extract features from the preprocessed images. 
AACO is applied to select a subset of features based on the encoded representation obtained from the VAE. 
Finally, the code trains a CNN model and an Adaptive SVM model using the selected features and evaluates the performance using accuracy.

This code assumes you have a list of image paths (`image_paths`) and a corresponding list of labels (`labels`) for your image dataset. 
The code applies an adaptive median filter, histogram equalization, and gamma correction to each image using the functions provided by the `skimage` library. 
The preprocessed images and labels are stored in `preprocessed_images` and `preprocessed_labels`, respectively.

The preprocessed images are then split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection`.
The VAE architecture, including the encoder and decoder networks, is defined and trained on the training set.

After training the VAE, the encoded features are extracted using the encoder part of the VAE.
The feature selection step using Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization (AACO) is represented as a placeholder function (`feature_selection`) 
that you would need to implement with your AACO algorithm.

Next, the selected features are used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. You need to define and train your own CNN model using 
`selected_train_features` and `y_train`.

Lastly, an Adaptive Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained using the selected features. The SVM is initialized with a linear kernel, 
and the predictions are made on the selected test features. The accuracy of the SVM model is calculated and printed.

Please note that you need to implement the AACO algorithm and define/train your own CNN model according to your specific requirements and data characteristics.

In this code, the MNIST dataset is used as an example. The input images are enhanced using adaptive median filtering, histogram equalization,
and gamma correction. A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is then trained to extract features from the enhanced images.
Feature selection is performed using Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization (AACO) algorithm (you need to implement the AACO algorithm separately). 
Finally, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an Adaptive Support Vector Machine (SVM) are trained on the selected features,
and their accuracies are evaluated.

```

This code trains a VAE with a 2-dimensional latent space using the MNIST dataset. The input images are flattened to a vector of size 784. 
The VAE architecture consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder network maps the input to the mean and log-variance of the latent space. 
The reparameterization trick is used to sample from the latent space. The decoder network reconstructs the input image from the sampled latent space. 
The VAE is trained by minimizing the reconstruction loss and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned latent distribution and a standard 
normal distribution. The VAE is compiled with the Adam optimizer, and it is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 128.
