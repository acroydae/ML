Sure, here's how you can create an EfficientNet model from scratch using Keras and then proceed with training and evaluation:

```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# 4. EfficientNet Model
# Create an EfficientNet model and modify it for your task.
from efficientnet.tfkeras import EfficientNetB0

def create_efficientnet_model(num_classes):
    base_model = EfficientNetB0(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))
    
    # Freeze the pre-trained layers
    for layer in base_model.layers:
        layer.trainable = False
    
    # Add custom classification head
    model = keras.Sequential([
        base_model,
        keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling2D(),
        keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
        keras.layers.Dropout(0.5),
        keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
    ])
    
    return model

# 5. Training
# Train the model using optimized features and parameters.
def train_model(model, X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10):
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    
    history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size=batch_size, epochs=epochs, validation_split=0.2, verbose=2)
    
    return history

# 6. Evaluation and Validation
# Split the dataset for evaluation and validate the model.
def evaluate_model(model, X_val, y_val):
    loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_val, y_val)
    print(f"Validation Loss: {loss}, Validation Accuracy: {accuracy}")

# Split the dataset into train and validation sets
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an instance of the EfficientNet model with the number of classes as an argument
num_classes = 2  # Replace with the actual number of classes
model = create_efficientnet_model(num_classes)

# Train the model
history = train_model(model, X_train, y_train, batch_size=32, epochs=10)

# Evaluate the model on the validation set
evaluate_model(model, X_val, y_val)
```

In this code:

- We use the EfficientNetB0 architecture from the `efficientnet` package in TensorFlow/Keras. You can choose a different variant if needed.
- We freeze the pre-trained layers to fine-tune only the custom classification head.
- We compile and train the model using the specified batch size and number of epochs.
- Finally, we evaluate the model on the validation set to assess its performance.

Make sure to replace `num_classes`, `X_scaled`, `y`, and other parameters with appropriate values based on your dataset and requirements. Also, ensure you have the necessary libraries, including `efficientnet`, installed.
