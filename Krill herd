Here's an example code for implementing the Krill Herd algorithm in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate a random binary classification dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=20, n_informative=10, n_classes=2, random_state=42)

# Define the Krill Herd class
class KrillHerd:
    def __init__(self, population_size, max_iterations, k):
        self.population_size = population_size
        self.max_iterations = max_iterations
        self.k = k
        self.population = None
        self.best_solution = None
        self.best_fitness = None

    def initialize_population(self, n_features):
        self.population = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=(self.population_size, n_features))

    def fitness_function(self, X, y):
        selected_features = [i for i in range(X.shape[1]) if self.best_solution[i] == 1]
        if len(selected_features) == 0:
            return 0

        X_selected = X[:, selected_features]
        clf = SVC()
        clf.fit(X_selected, y)
        y_pred = clf.predict(X_selected)
        accuracy = accuracy_score(y, y_pred)

        return accuracy

    def optimize(self, X, y):
        n_features = X.shape[1]

        self.initialize_population(n_features)

        self.best_solution = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.best_fitness = 0

        iteration = 0
        while iteration < self.max_iterations:
            for i in range(self.population_size):
                selected_features = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=n_features)
                swarm = np.copy(self.population)
                swarm[i] = selected_features

                fitness_swarm = [self.fitness_function(X, y) for _ in range(self.population_size)]

                index = np.argmax(fitness_swarm)
                if fitness_swarm[index] > self.best_fitness:
                    self.best_fitness = fitness_swarm[index]
                    self.best_solution = np.copy(swarm[index])

                for j in range(n_features):
                    if np.random.rand() < self.k:
                        self.population[i, j] = swarm[index, j]

            iteration += 1

        return self.best_solution

# Define the parameters for Krill Herd algorithm
population_size = 10
max_iterations = 50
k = 0.5

# Create an instance of KrillHerd class
krill_herd = KrillHerd(population_size, max_iterations, k)

# Apply Krill Herd algorithm for feature selection
selected_features = krill_herd.optimize(X, y)

print("Selected Features:", selected_features)
```

In this code, the Krill Herd algorithm is implemented as a class called `KrillHerd`.
The algorithm starts by generating an initial population of binary feature vectors.
It then iteratively updates the population based on the fitness function, which measures the accuracy of a
support vector machine (SVM) classifier trained on the selected features. The algorithm searches for the best solution 
(i.e., feature vector) with the highest fitness value.

To use the code, you can modify the parameters such as `population_size`, `max_iterations`, and `k` according to your needs. 
The code assumes that you have a binary classification dataset stored in `X` (input features) and `y` (class labels).
After running the code, it will print the selected features, represented by a binary vector.

Sure! Here's an example code for implementing the Krill Herd algorithm for feature selection in image processing using Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
digits = load_digits()
X, y = digits.data, digits.target

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Initialize the Krill Herd algorithm parameters
num_krills = 20
max_iterations = 100
d = X_train.shape[1]  # Number of features
c_min, c_max = np.min(X_train, axis=0), np.max(X_train, axis=0)  # Feature value range
d_min, d_max = 0, 1  # Search space range

# Initialize the krills' positions and velocities
positions = np.random.uniform(d_min, d_max, size=(num_krills, d))
velocities = np.zeros_like(positions)

# Define the objective function (SVM accuracy)
def objective_function(features):
    svm = SVC()
    svm.fit(X_train[:, features], y_train)
    y_pred = svm.predict(X_test[:, features])
    return accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

# Iterate over the specified number of iterations
for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    for i in range(num_krills):
        # Update the krill's velocity
        c1, c2 = np.random.rand(), np.random.rand()
        velocities[i] = velocities[i] + c1 * (positions[i] - positions) + c2 * (positions[i] - np.mean(positions, axis=0))

        # Update the krill's position
        positions[i] = positions[i] + velocities[i]

        # Clip the position within the search space range
        positions[i] = np.clip(positions[i], d_min, d_max)

    # Evaluate the objective function for each krill
    objective_values = [objective_function(np.where(positions[i] >= (d_min + positions[i] * (d_max - d_min)), 1, 0)) for i in range(num_krills)]

    # Update the best position and best objective value
    best_index = np.argmax(objective_values)
    best_position = positions[best_index]
    best_objective_value = objective_values[best_index]

    # Update the krills' positions and velocities based on the best position
    for i in range(num_krills):
        r1, r2 = np.random.rand(), np.random.rand()
        velocities[i] = velocities[i] + r1 * (best_position - positions[i]) + r2 * (best_position - np.mean(positions, axis=0))
        positions[i] = positions[i] + velocities[i]
        positions[i] = np.clip(positions[i], d_min, d_max)

# Select the best features based on the best position
selected_features = np.where(best_position >= (d_min + best_position * (d_max - d_min)), True, False)

# Train the SVM classifier using the selected features
svm = SVC()
svm.fit(X_train[:, selected_features], y_train)
y_pred = svm.predict(X_test[:, selected_features])
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)

print("Selected Features:", selected_features)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

In this code, the Krill Herd algorithm is used for feature selection in image processing. The algorithm iteratively updates 
the positions and velocities of the

 krills (features) based on their objective values (SVM accuracy). The best position and objective value are updated in each iteration, 
 and the selected features are determined based on the best position. Finally, an SVM classifier is trained using the selected features, 
 and the accuracy is evaluated on the testing dataset.

You can modify this code according to your specific image dataset and feature extraction technique.
