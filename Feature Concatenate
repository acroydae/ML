To concatenate the feature vectors from various feature extraction methods into a single feature vector, you can use NumPy's `np.concatenate` function. Here's how you can modify your `extract_features` function to concatenate the feature vectors:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
from skimage.feature import hog

def extract_features(image_path):
    # Load the image using OpenCV
    image = cv2.imread(image_path)
    
    # Convert the image to grayscale
    gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Calculate HOG features
    hog_features = hog(gray_image, pixels_per_cell=(8, 8), cells_per_block=(2, 2))
    
    # Implement SIFT and SURF feature extraction (replace with your implementations)
    sift_features = extract_sift_features(image)
    surf_features = extract_surf_features(image)
    
    # Convert the image to HSV color space
    hsv_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    
    # Calculate HSV histogram features
    h_hist = cv2.calcHist([hsv_image], [0], None, [256], [0, 256])
    s_hist = cv2.calcHist([hsv_image], [1], None, [256], [0, 256])
    v_hist = cv2.calcHist([hsv_image], [2], None, [256], [0, 256])
    hsv_histogram = np.concatenate((h_hist, s_hist, v_hist))
    
    # Concatenate all feature vectors into a single feature vector
    combined_features = np.concatenate((hog_features, sift_features, surf_features, hsv_histogram))
    
    return combined_features

# Define your SIFT and SURF feature extraction functions separately and replace
# extract_sift_features and extract_surf_features with their actual implementations.
def extract_sift_features(image):
    # Implement SIFT feature extraction here
    return sift_features

def extract_surf_features(image):
    # Implement SURF feature extraction here
    return surf_features
```

In this code, the HOG, SIFT, SURF, and HSV histogram features are calculated separately, and then they are concatenated into the `combined_features` vector using `np.concatenate`. Replace the placeholder functions for SIFT and SURF with your actual implementations for these feature extraction methods.
