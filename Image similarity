Step 1: Preprocessing
In this step, we'll preprocess the input images to make them suitable for feature extraction. The preprocessing steps may include resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and converting them to the appropriate format. Here's an example of how you can perform image preprocessing using the Python Imaging Library (PIL):

```python
from PIL import Image

def preprocess_image(image_path, target_size):
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    image = image.resize(target_size)
    image = image.convert('RGB')
    image = np.array(image)
    image = image.astype('float32')
    image /= 255.0
    return image
```

Step 2: Feature Extraction with ResNet50 and VGG16
In this step, we'll extract features from the preprocessed images using pre-trained ResNet50 and VGG16 models. These models are available in popular deep learning frameworks like Keras and PyTorch. Here's an example of how you can extract features using Keras:

```python
from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50
from keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input as resnet_preprocess_input
from keras.applications.vgg16 import preprocess_input as vgg_preprocess_input

def extract_resnet_features(image):
    model = ResNet50(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, pooling='avg')
    image = resnet_preprocess_input(image)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    features = model.predict(image)
    return features

def extract_vgg_features(image):
    model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, pooling='avg')
    image = vgg_preprocess_input(image)
    image = np.expand_dims(image, axis=0)
    features = model.predict(image)
    return features
```

Step 3: Feature Fusion with PCA
In this step, we'll combine the features extracted from ResNet50 and VGG16 using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA helps reduce the dimensionality of the feature vectors while retaining the most important information. Here's an example of how you can perform feature fusion using PCA:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

def feature_fusion(features_resnet, features_vgg, n_components):
    features_combined = np.concatenate((features_resnet, features_vgg), axis=1)
    pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)
    features_combined = pca.fit_transform(features_combined)
    return features_combined
```

Step 4: Similarity Calculation using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
In this step, we'll use Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the optimal threshold value for determining similarity between images. PSO is a population-based optimization algorithm that mimics the behavior of a swarm of particles. Here's an example of how you can perform similarity calculation using PSO:

```python
from pyswarm import pso

def similarity_calculation_pso(features, labels, k):
    def objective_function(threshold, features, labels, k):
        # Calculate similarity

 scores based on the threshold
        similarity_scores = calculate_similarity(features, threshold)

        # Apply KNN to determine the predicted labels
        predicted_labels = knn(similarity_scores, labels, k)

        # Calculate accuracy
        accuracy = calculate_accuracy(labels, predicted_labels)
        
        # The objective is to maximize the accuracy, so we return the negative value
        return -accuracy

    # Define the lower and upper bounds for the threshold
    lower_bound = 0.0
    upper_bound = 1.0

    # Perform PSO optimization
    threshold_opt, _ = pso(objective_function, lower_bound, upper_bound, args=(features, labels, k))

    # Calculate similarity scores based on the optimal threshold
    similarity_scores_opt = calculate_similarity(features, threshold_opt)

    # Apply KNN to determine the predicted labels
    predicted_labels_opt = knn(similarity_scores_opt, labels, k)

    return predicted_labels_opt
```

Step 5: Similarity Calculation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
In this step, we'll use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to determine the similarity between images based on their feature vectors. KNN is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. Here's an example of how you can perform similarity calculation using KNN:

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

def similarity_calculation_knn(features, labels, k):
    # Train a KNN classifier
    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)
    knn.fit(features, labels)

    # Predict the labels based on the KNN classifier
    predicted_labels = knn.predict(features)

    return predicted_labels
```

These are the main steps involved in image similarity calculation using image data, preprocessing, feature extraction with ResNet50 and VGG16, feature fusion with PCA, and similarity calculation using PSO and KNN. You can integrate these steps into your own code and customize them according to your needs. Remember to import the required libraries and preprocess your image data appropriately.
