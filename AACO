Here's an example code for feature selection using Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization (AACO) in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

class AACO:
    def __init__(self, num_ants, num_iterations, pheromone_init, alpha, beta, rho, q0):
        self.num_ants = num_ants
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations
        self.pheromone_init = pheromone_init
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.beta = beta
        self.rho = rho
        self.q0 = q0

    def fit(self, X, y):
        num_features = X.shape[1]
        num_samples = X.shape[0]
        self.pheromone = np.ones((num_features,))

        for iteration in range(self.num_iterations):
            ant_solutions = []

            for ant in range(self.num_ants):
                features = np.arange(num_features)
                ant_solution = np.zeros((num_features,))

                for i in range(num_features):
                    remaining_features = np.where(features > 0)[0]
                    probabilities = self.pheromone[remaining_features] ** self.alpha
                    heuristic = (1 / np.sum(remaining_features)) ** self.beta
                    probabilities = probabilities * heuristic
                    probabilities = probabilities / np.sum(probabilities)

                    if np.random.uniform(0, 1) < self.q0:
                        feature_index = np.argmax(probabilities)
                    else:
                        feature_index = np.random.choice(remaining_features, size=1, p=probabilities)[0]

                    ant_solution[feature_index] = 1
                    features[feature_index] = 0

                ant_solutions.append(ant_solution)

            ant_solutions = np.array(ant_solutions)
            fitness = self._calculate_fitness(ant_solutions, X, y)
            best_solution = ant_solutions[np.argmax(fitness)]
            best_fitness = np.max(fitness)

            self.pheromone = (1 - self.rho) * self.pheromone
            self.pheromone += self.rho * (best_solution * best_fitness)

    def _calculate_fitness(self, ant_solutions, X, y):
        fitness = []

        for solution in ant_solutions:
            selected_features = np.where(solution == 1)[0]
            X_selected = X[:, selected_features]
            # Use a classifier or other evaluation metric to calculate the fitness
            # fitness_value = evaluate(X_selected, y)
            fitness_value = np.mean(np.abs(X_selected - y))  # Dummy fitness calculation
            fitness.append(fitness_value)

        return np.array(fitness)
```

In this code, the AACO class is defined to perform feature selection using the Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization algorithm.
The `fit` method takes the input data `X` and corresponding labels `y` as input. It initializes the pheromone matrix and iterates over a
given number of iterations. In each iteration, the algorithm constructs solutions for each ant by selecting features based on the pheromone 
values and a probability calculation. The selected features are used to calculate the fitness of each ant solution. 
The best solution and its fitness value are updated, and the pheromone matrix is updated accordingly. 
After the iterations, the pheromone matrix represents the importance of each feature based on the AACO algorithm.

Please note that in this code, the fitness calculation is a placeholder (`np.mean(np.abs(X_selected - y))`).
You would need to replace it with an appropriate fitness calculation method for your specific problem and evaluation metric.

To use the AACO class, you can create an instance of the class and call the `fit` method, passing your

 input data and labels. Afterward, you can retrieve the selected features based on the pheromone matrix.

 Implementing the Adaptive Ant Colony Optimization (AACO) algorithm for feature selection requires defining the fitness function and the
 AACO algorithm itself. Here's an example code that demonstrates feature selection using AACO in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define AACO parameters
n_ants = 10
n_iterations = 10
n_features = X.shape[1]
tau_initial = 0.1
alpha = 1.0
beta = 2.0
rho = 0.1

# Initialize pheromone matrix
pheromone = np.ones((n_features,))

# Define fitness function
def evaluate_fitness(features):
    # Train SVM classifier and compute accuracy
    svm = SVC()
    svm.fit(X_train[:, features], y_train)
    y_pred = svm.predict(X_test[:, features])
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    return accuracy

# AACO algorithm
for iteration in range(n_iterations):
    # Initialize ant solutions
    ant_solutions = []
    
    # Construct ant solutions
    for ant in range(n_ants):
        features = []
        
        for feature in range(n_features):
            # Compute probability of selecting the feature
            p = (pheromone[feature] ** alpha) * (evaluate_fitness(features + [feature]) ** beta)
            
            # Randomly select the feature based on probability
            if np.random.rand() < p:
                features.append(feature)
        
        ant_solutions.append(features)
    
    # Update pheromone matrix
    delta_pheromone = np.zeros_like(pheromone)
    
    for ant_solution in ant_solutions:
        for feature in ant_solution:
            delta_pheromone[feature] += 1.0 / evaluate_fitness(ant_solution)
    
    pheromone = (1.0 - rho) * pheromone + delta_pheromone
    
# Select best features based on pheromone values
best_features = np.argsort(pheromone)[-3:]

print("Selected features:", best_features)
```

In this code, we use the Iris dataset as an example. The AACO algorithm is applied to select the best features based on the fitness function, 
which is the accuracy of an SVM classifier. The algorithm constructs ant solutions by iteratively selecting features based on the probability 
computed using pheromone values and fitness values. The pheromone values are updated based on the quality of the solutions. 
Finally, the best features are selected based on the highest pheromone values.
